## 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard

### 🏢 Business Problem



Employee attrition (turnover) is one of the biggest challenges faced by organizations. High attrition leads to:



Increased recruitment \& training costs



Loss of experienced talent



Decrease in productivity \& morale



The goal of this project is to analyze HR data, identify key factors driving attrition, and provide actionable insights to improve employee retention.

### 

### 🎯 Project Objectives



Identify patterns and trends in employee attrition.



Analyze the impact of salary, department, satisfaction, promotions, and work hours on employee retention.



Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for HR leaders to make data-driven decisions.

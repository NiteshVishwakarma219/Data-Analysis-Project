📊 Data Analysis Project


🔍 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data to uncover meaningful insights, trends, and patterns that can support decision-making. It demonstrates skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and reporting using modern tools.

🎯 Objectives
    • Clean and preprocess raw data for accurate analysis.
    • Explore and visualize key patterns in the dataset.
    • Derive actionable insights to support business decisions.
    • Build interactive dashboards/reports for stakeholders.


🗂️ Dataset
    • Source: [Mention source, e.g., Kaggle, internal HR dataset, sales logs, etc.]
    • Size: [e.g., 10,000 rows × 15 columns]
    • Key Features:
        ◦ Employee/Customer/Product details
        ◦ Performance/Sales/Attrition metrics
        ◦ Categorical & numerical variables


🛠️ Tools & Technologies
    • Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) and SQL
    • Visualization: Power BI  / Matplotlib 
    • Data Handling: Excel / CSV / SQL Database
    • Other: GitHub


📌 Process
    1. Data Collection → Importing raw data from CSV/Excel/Database.
    2. Data Cleaning → Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting.
    3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Identifying trends, distributions, and correlations.
    4. Visualization → Graphs, dashboards, and KPI tracking.
    5. Insights & Recommendations → Business interpretations based on findings.


📊 Key Insights (Example)
    • Higher employee attrition in certain departments with low satisfaction scores.
    • Sales peaked in Q4, mainly due to holiday campaigns.
    • Customers with higher engagement frequency show 2x retention rates.


📈 Dashboard / Visuals

Include screenshots of Power BI/Excel dashboard or charts:


🚀 Outcomes
    • Improved decision-making through data-driven insights.
    • Clear identification of key factors influencing performance.
    • Ready-to-use dashboard for ongoing business tracking.
